# gitbook-plugin-webpd_porres_examples

An extension for gitbook-plugin-webpd with many pd examples

This is used [here](https://github.com/jahpd/gitbook-plugin-webpd), and is a repository for many [webpd](https://github.com/sebpiq/WebPd) examples in a [Porres PD tutorial](https://github.com/jahpd/porres_tutorialpd)

# Download

You can download by [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

But gitbook will do this by default. So don't need to worry.
